/I think I put the to-do list in the cabinet.
/...I forgot I put the lock on it. It’ll take forever to look for the key, though.
/Maybe I can break the lock?
/I could totally break it with this!

/I’ve already got the bat. I should go back to the cabinet.
/Alright, I’ve got the list! Now let’s see here...
/Huh. I think I can manage all of these with just the stuff in the house, but
I better check on the problems first.
