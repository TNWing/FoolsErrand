Baseball Bat
"Pretty good for making a funny ""thwack"" noise."
/Glue
White, sticky liquid makes a good adhesive wouldn't you say?
/Wood
Strong and durable, useful indeed.
/Clothes
Rippable at the seams.
/Closet Doors
Picked straight from the old wardrobe!
/Curtains
Soft and silky, could be a good substitute for something.
/Nails
Not the ones on your hands.
/Chair
For a single person, you could do without one extra chair.
/Wood
A little dusty, sturdy enough to hold up those books.
/Paper
Feels durable enough to write on.
/Pen
Slightly running out of ink, but still functional.
